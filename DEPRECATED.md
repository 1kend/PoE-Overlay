# Deprecated

The current version you're using is deprecated and may no longer work after a major PoE update.

## How to update

1. Uninstall the current version
2. Download the new version from <REPLACE_ME>
3. Run the downloaded installer

## What is new?

The new version is no longer built with Electron but Overwolf instead. Overwolf provides a platform for building performant in-game overlays. They also work closely with game publishers to make sure you never get banned. See more of their [commitment to gamers here](https://www.overwolf.com/our-commitment).
