PoE Overlay lets you search the market and request items and helps you to evaluate the price of your items. As well as getting insights for your maps before running them and allows you to rewatch important game events like your player death.

It also offers a seamless integrated user interface with **all client languages** available.

## ✨ Features

### Evaluate

Quickly evaluate your items. Properties can be added and removed from the query with a simple click. Values can be adjusted with scrolling. Clicking a listing will then copy a formatted note.

### Inspect

Items can be inspected to gather helpful insights. For most items you can get the drop location and you can always open the item in the official wiki or poe.db for detailed information.

For maps you will see dangerous stats, community ratings and the actual bosses and last but not least the loot.
